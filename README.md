# GFile

gfile is a WebRTC based file exchange software.

It allows to share a file directly between two computers, without the need of a third party.

## Note

This project is still in its early stage.

As of today, it works well with small files. It doesn't work with huge file, due to disconnection issues. (WIP)

## Usage

### Sender

```bash
gfile send --file filename
```

-   Run the command
-   A base64 encoded SDP will appear, send it to the remote client
-   Follow the instruction to curl the client's SDP to your process
-   The file transfer should start

> Due to terms restrictions (ability to treat lines with +1024 characters), the SDP must be send through `curl`

### Receiver

```bash
# SDP being the base64 SDP gotten from the other client
echo "$SDP" | gfile receive -o filename
```

-   Pipe the other client's SDP to gfile
-   A base64 encoded SDP will appear, send it to the remote client
-   The file transfer should start

# GFile

gfile is a WebRTC based file exchange software.

It allows to share a file directly between two computers, without the need of a third party.

## Note

This project is still in its early stage.

As of today, it works well with small files. It doesn't work with huge files, due to disconnection issues. (WIP)

## Usage

### Sender

```bash
gfile send --file filename
```

-   Run the command
-   A base64 encoded SDP will appear, send it to the remote client
-   Follow the instructions to send the client's SDP to your process
-   The file transfer should start

### Receiver

```bash
# SDP being the base64 SDP gotten from the other client
echo "$SDP" | gfile receive -o filename
```

-   Pipe the other client's SDP to gfile
-   A base64 encoded SDP will appear, send it to the remote client
-   The file transfer should start

### Benchmark

`gfile` is able to benchmark the network speed between 2 clients (1 _master_ and 1 _slave_) with the `bench` command.
For detailed instructions, see `Sender` and `Receiver` instructions.

#### Master
```bash
# Run as 'master'
gfile bench -m

# Run as 'slave'
echo "$SDP" |  gfile bench
```

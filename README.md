# GFile

gfile is a WebRTC based file exchange software.

It allows to share a file directly between two computers, without the need of a third party.

## Note

This project is still in its early stage.

## How does it work ?

![Schema](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11705040/55741923-4dd89a80-59e3-11e9-917c-daf9f08f164d.png)

The [STUN server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) is only used to retrieve informations metadata (how to connect the two clients). The data you transfer with `gfile` **does not transit through it**.

> More informations [here](https://webrtc.org/)

## Usage

### Sender

```bash
gfile send --file filename
```

-   Run the command
-   A base64 encoded [SDP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566) will appear, send it to the remote client
-   Follow the instructions to send the client's SDP to your process
-   The file transfer should start

### Receiver

```bash
# SDP being the base64 SDP gotten from the other client
echo "$SDP" | gfile receive -o filename
```

-   Pipe the other client's SDP to gfile
-   A base64 encoded SDP will appear, send it to the remote client
-   The file transfer should start

### Benchmark

`gfile` is able to benchmark the network speed between 2 clients (1 _master_ and 1 _slave_) with the `bench` command.
For detailed instructions, see `Sender` and `Receiver` instructions.

This feature is still an experiment.

```bash
# Run as 'master'
gfile bench -m

# Run as 'slave'
echo "$SDP" |  gfile bench
```

### Web Interface

A web interface is being developed via WebAssembly. It is currently **not** working.

### Debug

In order to obtain a more verbose output, it is possible to define the logging level via the `GFILE_LOG` environment variable.

> Example: `export GFILE_LOG="TRACE"`
> See function `setupLogger` in  `main.go` for more information
